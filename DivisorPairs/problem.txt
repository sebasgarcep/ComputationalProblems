Let S(n) be the number of pairs (a,b) of distinct divisors of n such that a divides b.
For n=6 we get the following pairs: (1,2),(1,3),(1,6),(2,6) and (3,6). So S(6)=5.
Let pm# be the product of the first m prime numbers, so p2#=2∗3=6.
Let E(m,n) be the highest integer k such that 2k divides S((pm#)n).
E(2,1)=0 since 20 is the highest power of 2 that divides S(6)=5.
Let Q(n)=∑ni=1E(904961,i)
Q(8)=2714886.

Evaluate Q(1012).
