In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1x+1y=1n
For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

15+12016+11218+18=14=14=14
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
