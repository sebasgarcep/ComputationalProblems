The Golomb's self-describing sequence (G(n)) is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are

nG(n)112232435364748495105115126136146156……
You are given that G(103)=86, G(106)=6137.
You are also given that ∑G(n3)=153506976 for 1≤n<103.

Find ∑G(n3) for 1≤n<106.
