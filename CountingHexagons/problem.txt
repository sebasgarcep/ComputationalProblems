An equilateral triangle with integer side length n≥3 is divided into n2 equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the diagram below.
The vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with (n+1)(n+2)2 lattice points.

Let H(n) be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by connecting 6 of these points.

For example, H(3)=1, H(6)=12 and H(20)=966.

Find ∑n=312345H(n).
